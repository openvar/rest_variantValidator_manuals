# rest_variantValidator_manuals

Jupyter notebooks containing examples of effective use of the [VariantValidartor rest API](http://rest.variantvalidator.org)

## Community notebooks
**VariantValidator is an Open Source project which throughout its development has been significantly community driven**

***We want to keep it that way!***

If you have used the VariantValidator rest API why not create and commit a Jupyter notebook to help others make use of this resource?

If you want to contribute but want some advice first, contact us on [contact admin](https://variantvalidator.org/contact_admin/)
